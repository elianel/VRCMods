# VRCMods
## QuickMenu Persistence
- My implementation but not my idea.
- This mod is more useful in ***VR***.
- Required Dependencies: [UI Expansion Kit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#ui-expansion-kit).
- ***But what does it do though?*** It stops your quickmenu from closing (so you can move with it open in your hand).

## Player List
- ***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am well aware that vrchat added a player list too, this one is more convenient though.*
- Thanks to `Edward7` for showing me the player J/L xref
- Optional Dependencies: [UI Expansion Kit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#ui-expansion-kit)
